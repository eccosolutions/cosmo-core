DESCRIPTION:Welcome to the Chandler 0.6 Release!\n\nFor a wealth of informa
 tion for end-users and developers\, point your browser to:\n    http://cha
 ndler.osafoundation.org\n\nThere you can see presentations on the Vision o
 f Chandler\, details about this release\, screenshots and screencast demos
 \, documentation and tutorials for developers\, and how to participate in 
 testing and giving us feedback about your experience in experimenting with
  Chandler.\n\nThis release is focused on "experimentally usable" calendar 
 functionality. It meets the following four goals:\n\n1. Usable Calendar\nW
 e intend to use the 0.6 calendar internally at OSAF on a day-to-day basis 
 in order to experience first hand the features\, functionality\, limitatio
 ns\, and any bugs in the product. We believe using the product ourselves e
 arly on is the best way to ensure superlative design and implementation. T
 he calendar now includes timezones\, repeating events\, all-day events\, m
 ultiple overlaying calendars\, and shared collaborative (multi-author) gro
 up calendars using our new CalDAV-based calendar server.\n\n2. Polished Us
 er Interface\nAdding polish to the UI helps calendar usability. To a lesse
 r extent we have also polished other areas of the application UI.\n\n3. In
 frastructure Investment\n* Although the focus for this release is usable c
 alendar functionality\, we have invested in some projects for both develop
 er and Quality Assurance productivity. For example\, we have begun optimiz
 ing for performance\, and have developed automated QA code tests. We want 
 Chandler to be testable\, high quality source code.\n* In addition\, this 
 release also includes continuing infrastructure work on email and internat
 ionalization.\n\n4. Developer Platform\n* If you are an experienced Python
  programmer\, you should be able to create simple forms-based parcels like
  the Flickr\, Feeds\, and Amazon parcels that are included in the 0.6 rele
 ase.\n* Developer documentation\, tutorials\, and sample add-in parcels ar
 e part of this release.\n\nPlease note\, this release is still intended to
 r extent we have also polished other areas of the application UI.\n\n3. In

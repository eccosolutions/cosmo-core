Provides utilities and implementation classes for integrating the
Acegi Security System for Spring into Cosmo.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
Acegi Security integration classes are roughly broken down into three
categories:
</p>

<p>
The <code>providers.ticket</code> and <code>providers.homedir</code>
subpackages contain classes that implement Cosmo's custom
authentication and authorization schemes.
</p>

<p>
The <code>userdetails</code> package contains implementations of Acegi
Security's <code>UserDetails</code> and
<code>UserDetailsService</code> interfaces which give the security
framework access to Cosmo user data.
</p>

<p>
The <code>context</code> and <code>providers.anonymous</code> packages
contain classes that extend Acegi Security framework classes for
HTTP-based protocols such as WebDAV and CMP which are not
session-aware.
</p>

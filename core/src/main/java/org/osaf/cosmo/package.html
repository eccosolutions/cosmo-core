The base package for all Cosmo subsystems.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
The Cosmo subsystems can be roughly broken down into the following
(<em>including corresponding package names</em>):
</p>

<ul>
<li> the object model, which represents the content stored in the
  server (<em>model</em>)</li>
<li> data access objects that wrap Cosmo's data sources and convert
  raw data to and from the model(<em>dao</em>)</li>
<li> services that encapsulate Cosmo's &quot;business logic&quot; and
  use data access objects to persist the object model and interact
  with external services, like a mail server (<em>service</em>)</li>
<li> protocol handlers that fulfill the wishes of Cosmo clients via
  interactions with services and the model
  (<em>cmp</em>, <em>dav</em>, <em>feed</em>)</li>
<li> controllers, views, and framework classes for the Web Console
  (<em>ui</em>)</li>
<li> a facade that provides high level access to information about the
  security principal interacting with Cosmo via client protocol or Web
  Console (<em>security</em>)</li>
<li> extremely primitive instrumentation (<em>status</em>)</li>
<li> tools that provide utilities for working with data formats
  (<em>icalendar</em>)
<li> adapters that bridge the Cosmo API to and from external
  frameworks and subsystems
  (<em>acegisecurity</em></li>
<li> miscellaneous tools and utilities (<em>util</em>)</li>
</ul>

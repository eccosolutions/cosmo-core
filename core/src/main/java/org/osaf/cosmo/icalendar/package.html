Provides tools for working with the iCalendar data format.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
This package includes utilities for working with the iCalendar data
format as specified by RFC 2445 and defines those iCalendar components
that are specifically understood by Cosmo (others may be stored and
transmitted to and from clients but are not guaranteed to be queryable
or to be treated specially in the Web Console).
</p>

<p>
Classes in this package are heavily dependent on
the <strong>iCal4J</strong> library which provides an API for parsing
and outputting iCalendar streams and manipulating an iCalendar object
model.

Includes components that encapsulate access to Cosmo data sources.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
The interfaces in this package specify APIs for accessing and
manipulating Cosmo model data. The interfaces are independent of
underlying storage mechanisms (which are provided as subpackages).
</p>

<p>
Data access objects (DAOs) are typically not used by the application
or protocol layer directly but rather by the service layer, which
often uses multiple DAOs and applies server-wide &quot;business
logic&quot; when performing a service operation.
</p>
